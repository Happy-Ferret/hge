# Binding
* From C++, the hgeResourceManager is not implemented yet.

# Helpers
* Font needs to be extended to fully support the specified font file format.
* DistortionMesh seems to possibly be having issues because it's using float64
  instead of float32 (speculation.)

# Features
* Figuring out logical places to integrate channels (input handling perhaps.)
* Figuring out where interfaces could be better used.

# Finalization
* Ask for feedback about how the helpers are split up.
* Tests
* Documentation
* Cleanups
* Code review
